## The following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix. By allowing to use of 
## cache there is a sacing in the computational resources

## makeCacheMatrix is used by cacheSolve for setting and getting  the inverted matrix 
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y){
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmatrix <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getmatrix <- function() m
  list(set=set, get=get,
       setmatrix=setmatrix,
       getmatrix=getmatrix)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {   
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
  m <- x$getmatrix()
  if(!is.null(m)){
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  matrix <- x$get()
  m <- solve(matrix, ...)
  x$setmatrix(m)
  m
